1. Models: Define the Data Structures
Models define how data is structured in MongoDB. You'll need to create models for each of the core entities that will interact with your system:

User Model (students, tutors, and admins)

Session Model

Review Model

Wishlist Model

Verification Request Model

Report Model

2. Middleware: Authentication & Error Handling
This middleware will handle all authentication, authorization, and error handling logic. It’s important to set up user authentication for logging in students, tutors, and admins.

authMiddleware.js (JWT-based authentication for login and access control)

errorHandler.js (to catch and display errors uniformly across the API)

3. Controllers: Business Logic
After the models and middleware are set up, you'll define the controllers that implement the business logic for each feature.

Student Features:
Tutor Search and Filtering:

Implement a controller to query tutors based on filters like subject, location, price, rating, and availability.

Session Booking:

Handle session booking, availability, and validation of date/time conflicts.

Session Management:

Create functionality to manage upcoming and past sessions (create, read, update, delete).

Review and Rating:

Implement review submission, rating system, and real-time average rating updates for tutors.

Wishlist:

Allow students to add/remove tutors to/from their wishlist, and persist this data across sessions.

Tutor Features:
Profile Management:

Handle profile data, including personal information, subjects, hourly rates, and availability.

Session Management & Earnings:

Handle session requests, accept/reject, and track earnings (pending/completed).

Admin Features:
Tutor Verification:

Implement verification logic for tutors, including approval/rejection of requests.

Reporting:

Provide reporting features, displaying key metrics like popular subjects, session completion rates, and usage statistics.

4. Routes: API Endpoints
Once controllers are in place, you can create routes to handle the HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that communicate with the frontend.

authRoutes.js: For login, signup, and authentication.

studentRoutes.js: For student-specific actions like searching tutors, booking sessions, and managing reviews.

tutorRoutes.js: For tutor-specific actions like managing profile and session management.

adminRoutes.js: For admin-specific actions like tutor verification and generating reports.

5. Utilities: Helper Functions
validationUtils.js: Functions for validating user inputs (like rating, session data, etc.).

ratingUtils.js: Functions for updating and calculating the tutor’s rating in real-time.

Sequence of Tasks to Implement
Create Models (Step 1):

Start by defining schemas for User, Session, Review, Wishlist, Verification Request, and Report.

Implement Middleware (Step 2):

Write the authMiddleware to handle JWT authentication.

Set up the errorHandler middleware to manage errors.

Define Controllers (Step 3):

Write logic for each feature, ensuring that each function in the controller interacts with the MongoDB models and middleware.

Set Up Routes (Step 4):

Create RESTful API routes for each controller.

Implement Utilities (Step 5):

Write helper functions that can be reused for validation and rating logic.
