Sequence of Coding Implementation for EduConnect Pakistan Backend

1. **Models**:
   - The **models** are created first because they define the structure of the data that will be stored in MongoDB.
   - Models define how data is structured and ensure that the data used in controllers and routes is consistent.
   - **Files**: userModel.js, sessionModel.js, reviewModel.js, wishlistModel.js, verificationModel.js, reportModel.js

2. **Middleware**:
   - **Middleware** handles authentication, authorization, and error handling for all routes.
   - Authentication middleware is crucial for verifying JWT tokens (login/logout functionality).
   - Error handling ensures that the application provides meaningful responses for unexpected situations.
   - **Files**: authMiddleware.js, errorHandler.js

3. **Controllers**:
   - The **controllers** contain the business logic of the application.
   - After defining models and middleware, the controllers implement the actual features and functionalities, such as user registration, session booking, profile management, etc.
   - **Files**: authController.js, studentController.js, tutorController.js, adminController.js

4. **Routes**:
   - **Routes** map the frontend requests to the appropriate controller functions.
   - After the controllers are ready, routes are set up to listen for incoming API requests and route them to the controller's methods.
   - **Files**: authRoutes.js, studentRoutes.js, tutorRoutes.js, adminRoutes.js

5. **Utilities**:
   - **Utilities** are helper functions that simplify repetitive tasks, such as data validation, calculations, etc.
   - These functions are called within controllers and routes to handle tasks like validating form data or calculating ratings.
   - **Files**: validationUtils.js, ratingUtils.js

This sequence ensures that:
- **Data structure** is set up early, allowing the controller and route files to work seamlessly.
- **Authentication and error handling** are put in place early, ensuring that all routes are secure and properly managed.
- **Business logic** is implemented next to ensure the core features of the application work correctly.
- **Routing** follows naturally after controllers, and finally, helper functions are added last as they rely on data manipulation done earlier.

By following this sequence, we can build EduConnect Pakistan systematically and ensure that all the backend features are implemented efficiently.
